PSL version 1.00
based off sketches and early pixel art from 2017-2020. 
using React-Game-Kit

The character leaves their bedroom, goes into a coffee shop, and can go to a third area out the door.
The character can interact with objects in their bedroom, interact with people in the coffee shop
the character enters adventure mode when they leave and go onto the 3rd room (outside)
characters in the coffee shop will move around freely, and have collision and roles they play outside of the coffee shop
antagonists outside of the home are plastic bag characters

25 rooms initially designed, and 2 massive epics are developed.  I'll spend much of the summer breaking those down into shorter stories
